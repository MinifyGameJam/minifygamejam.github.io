No one! This is the first Minify Game Jam!<br/><br/>
<h2>What is Minify Game Jam?</h2>
Minify Game Jam is a solo, hacker-friendly, game development competition held usually twice a month. It is a small jam for people with large schedules that can write tiny amounts of code that do amazing things.<br/><br/>
<h2>Rules</h2>
The rules are simple. Create a game, in 24 hours, that runs on Linux and/or PC (sorry mac), that fully implements that months theme. The games will be judged on how small they are, primarily, and uniqueness adds bonus points. The winner will be on the main page for a month, and get to gloat to all his friends on IRC.
