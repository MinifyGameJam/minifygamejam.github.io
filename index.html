<h2>What is Minify Game Jam?</h2>
Minify Game Jam is a solo, hacker-friendly, game development competition held usually once a month. It is a small jam for people with large schedules that can write tiny amounts of code that do amazing things.
<h2>Rules</h2>
The rules are simple. Create a game, in 24 hours, that runs on Linux and/or PC (sorry mac), that fully implements that month's theme. The games will be judged on the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>how much code it took to implement*</li>
<li>originality</li> 
<li>how well it executes its concept</li>
</ol>
* 3rd party libraries won't be included in amount of code it took to write.(Within reason) if you open source your framework, we won't include that code in our estimation of project minimalism.
<h2>Rewards</h2>
The winner will be on the main page for a month and get to gloat to all of his or her friends on IRC. Also, the winner gets to experience the pride of being better than everyone else.
